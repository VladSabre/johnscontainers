This project has a couple of issues (specified on the issues tab) that are to be fixed in the following couple of days. They don't seem to be failing any points per se (apart from maybe point 4 of the AC - coverage is far from being reasonable) but they make the demo look incomplete. Ideally I'd like to fix them before hanging the code over for review, but since I planned to finish it on Friday (and only doing it on Monday) I feel terrible for making you wait. The previous week turned out to be much more busy than I anticipated, so I haven't been able to spent the planned amount of time on this exercise.
